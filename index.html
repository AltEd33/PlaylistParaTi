        Even though things ended this way, and the pain still lingers every day as I get to remember what you made me feel on the last days we were together, I will forever be greatful for the experience that was loving you with all the strength in my heart, I'm sorry that maybe it wasn't enough. This is not for you to see, but for me to keep the biggest show of love that I've ever created somewhere to be found. Thank you for making me feel this form of love. I hope you get to live a happy life and you accomplish your dreams.
